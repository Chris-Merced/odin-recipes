        <h3>Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish consisting of layers of wide pasta sheets, rich meat sauce,
             creamy béchamel, and melted cheese, baked to golden perfection.</h3>
        <p>
            With origins dating back to ancient Greece, lasagna has evolved into countless variations, incorporating 
            diverse ingredients like vegetables, seafood, or even replacing the meat with plant-based alternatives
            for vegetarians and vegans. Its versatility makes it a staple in family gatherings, casual dinners, and 
            upscale dining alike, transcending cultural boundaries to become a beloved comfort food across the globe.
            Whether served steaming hot from the oven or enjoyed as leftovers the next day, lasagna never fails to 
            delight with its harmonious blend of flavors and textures.

            <li>1 box (about 9 ounces) lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions - </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
            </li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened,
                about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.
            </li>
            <li>Add the ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet and cook until browned, breaking it apart with a
                spoon as it cooks.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the
                sauce for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens slightly.
            </li>
            <li>While the sauce simmers, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set
                aside.
            </li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, egg, and grated Parmesan cheese until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
                Arrange a layer of cooked lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, overlapping slightly.
            </li>
            <li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle with one cup of shredded mozzarella
                cheese. Repeat the layers, ending with a final layer of meat sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese on 
                top.
            </li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the
                foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.
            </li>
            <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy your homemade classic meat 
                lasagna!
