        <h3>Tostones are a popular dish in Latin American and Caribbean cuisine, made from sliced green plantains
             that are fried, smashed, and fried again until crispy. </h3>
        <p>Tostones, with their crispy exterior and soft interior, offer a delightful contrast in texture and a
            mild, slightly sweet flavor reminiscent of bananas. After being fried once to soften, the plantain 
            slices are flattened with a kitchen tool or the bottom of a glass before being fried again to achieve
            their characteristic crunchiness. This double-frying method ensures a satisfyingly crispy result,
            perfect for dipping into sauces or enjoying on their own as a tasty appetizer or snack.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients -</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large green plantains</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
            <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
            <li>Optional: Garlic powder or dipping sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions -</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut off both ends of each plantain.</li>
            <li>Make a shallow slit along the length of the plantain skins</li>
            <li>Use your fingers to peel away the skin. If the plantains are very green, the skin may be more
                difficult to remove, so work carefully.</li>
            <li>Cut the peeled plantains into 1-inch thick slices.</li>
            <li>Heat a skillet or frying pan over medium-high heat and add enough vegetable oil to cover the plantain
                 slices.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot (about 350°F or 175°C), carefully add the plantain slices in batches. Do not
                overcrowd the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Fry the plantains for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until they are golden and slightly tender.
                They should not be fully cooked at this stage.</li>
            <li>Remove the plantain slices from the oil and drain them on paper towels.</li>
            <li>Use the bottom of a glass, a plate, or a tostonera (a special press for making tostones) to flatten
                 each plantain slice to about half its original thickness.</li>
            <li>If the plantains stick, you can lightly oil the pressing tool.</li>
            <li>Return the flattened plantains to the hot oil in batches.</li>
            <li>Fry them again for about 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are crispy and golden brown.</li>
            <li>Remove the tostones from the oil and drain them on paper towels.
            </li>
            <li>While the tostones are still hot, sprinkle them with salt to taste. You can also add garlic powder 
                if you like.
            </li>
            <li>Serve immediately with your favorite dipping sauce or as a side dish.
            </li>
        </ol>
